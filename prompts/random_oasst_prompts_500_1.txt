Write a greentext story.
A greentext is defined as "A popular device used for quotation and storytelling. They began on chan imageboards, where quoting text places a > in front of it, turning it green. This effect can also be done manually. Before long, this feature was put to innovative use. When quoting another post, greentext is frequently used for summary, criticism, and ridicule. Its other major use is storytelling, in which a lengthy story is told through fragmentary statements in greentext."
An example of a greentext story is, "
>be me
>23 days ago
>driving drunk as fuck, run a red light, ram into a fucking cop car at 20 mph
>cars are not too damaged
>drunk mind is scared as shit
>unable think of a reason, stab myself with my pocket knife before the cop comes over

Users on good computers report that the game is a lot of fun. although users on older PC's and laptops report the game is lagging and stuttering and the loading times are long. each time they enter a house and when they exit a house loading times are 15-20 seconds. when observing a tester I noticed he tries to avoid entering homes or shops as much as possible to avoid loading times.
The game was made in unity. it is single-player 3D  and plays in a single city with loading zones for each house. If I want to increase the quantity of people having fun in the game what should be done?

summarise the following in 300 words or less: "The neobank has outlined a bold plan to kickstart a new generation of virtual-savvy customers.
The current crisis may have upended operations of Hong Kong’s banking industry, but for Hong
Kong virtual-only lender Mox Bank, it is a time rife with opportunity.
“We saw that as a result of COVID-19 outbreak, that more and more people are living their lives
virtually or online—whether it's online shopping, for work, study or entertainment,” Deniz
Güven, CEO of Mox Bank, told Asian Banking & Finance and Hong Kong Business in an exclusive
interview.
“We believe the pandemic has made many more consumers in Hong Kong to adopt and be
comfortable in living their lives virtually, whether it's shopping, dining, learning,” he later added.
The plethora of prospects that the new normal has opened for digital financial offerors aligns with
Mox Bank’s proposition, whose name reflects the endless opportunities it plans to create with its
customers—which the lender cheekily refers to as “Generation Mox.” Unlike other virtual banking
propositions in APAC, Mox does not only target a single generation or segment, but intends to
focus on providing personalised banking services for each individual customer’s life stages.
“Our research spoke of wanting savings and spending advice, based on their life stages, not how
much they already have. They want advice to help them track and achieve their life goals. They
want even better security and fraud monitoring in these times of e-commerce. They want more
services and rewards out of their banks, and this is what we will initially focus on,” said Güven. He
also revealed that prior to its beta launch, the bank—whose parent company is the British
multinational finance giant Standard Chartered, in partnership with PCCW, HKT, and Trip.com—
conducted surveys with over 2,000 people to learn more what they desire from the neobank.
Mox’s first project is launching Asia’s first all-in-one numberless bank card in partnership with
Mastercard—a physical card for spending and ATM cash withdrawals and without any printed card
numbers, expiry date, or card verifications. Instead, these could be accessed from the Mox
banking app.
Asian Banking & Finance had a chat with CEO Güven to learn more about Mox Bank’s entrance in
Hong Kong’s banking industry as well as its vision of growth for the bank in the coming years.
What was the idea behind the name "Mox"? How does the name of your bank represent
how you want to position yourself in the banking industry?
Many folks have asked how we came about with our name and logo. Well, it was actually quite a
simple journey. We researched, asked potential customers, we went through more than 2,000
naming suggestions, before we found the one we all like—Mox.
Mox can mean many things. It reflects the endless opportunities we can create—Mobile
eXperience; Money eXperience; Money X (multiplier), eXponential growth, eXploration. It’s all up
for us to define, together. As for our logo and our visual design, they are inspired by the round
shape of a Hong Kong dollar coin, which is also a nod to our roots. We take pride in being one of

Hong Kong’s newest virtual banks, complementing Standard Chartered’s heritage of being Hong
Kong’s oldest note-issuing bank with over 160 years of experience in serving the community.
What are your thoughts in being one of Hong Kong's newest virtual-only banks? What is
your outlook for the local virtual banking industry?
We are excited about the opportunities ahead. Despite the many retail banks available in Hong
Kong, with the many online banking services available to consumers, we believe there are still
gaps in banking services that people need today. There is an underserved customer base in Hong
Kong.
We’ve been listening to what customers want, and we’ve been researching on what’s missing in
banking. We spoke with over 2,000 people and they all tell us they want new and better
experiences. They spoke of wanting savings or spending advice, based on their life stages, not how
much they have. They want advice to help them track and achieve their life goals. And we saw
that as a result of COVID-19 outbreak, that more and more people are living their lives virtually or
online—whether its online shopping, for work, study or entertainment.
What’s important to note is that Mox is connecting banking into people’s everyday lives and
shaping a new model that just might reflect the future of banking. Banking has to be simple,
intuitive and even delightful, to consumers.
What is Mox Bank's charm point? How do you plan to establish your foothold in the
industry amidst competition from other lenders?
We are in the business of trust and we take pride in being a subsidiary of Standard Chartered Bank
and its heritage of over 160 years in serving the community. Our differentiator from other VBs is
our customer experience and the partners we have, bringing new ways of rewards and spending.
You need partners to build an ecosystem and diversify distribution channels, particularly for the
service-led bank that Mox is conceived to be. We wanted Mox to become integral to people’s daily
lives, so working with partners that had already achieved this, to create joint service offerings,
was key to our value proposition.
Tell us more about your offerings. Who is your target customer base? What services does
Mox Bank offer, or plan to?
Mox is simply a smarter, easier, delightful way to bank. Everything we do is based on extensive
research to identify what truly matters to you and to solve real pain points. We will deliver a suite
of retail financial services as well as lifestyle benefits all in one place, with the focus of providing
financial well-being to our customers.
We are reaching out to the Generation Mox in Hong Kong. They’re a tribe of creative, curious and
connected people, who want to do more, feel more, see more. They’re digitally savvy, regardless
of age. They want to grow, individually, financially, as a community and a society.
For starters, we’re bringing to Hong Kong a whole new experience for savings and spending. We
want to get customers to form good savings habits, and we will help them automate this.
Customers can set up specific savings goals and be in a better position to track their progress, and
focus on achieving them one by one. Savings Calculator and other tools help customers to
automate saving habits. Customers will earn daily interest.
We believe this is the most important service for HK people. They cannot find the best saving
product out there.
Mox launched Asia's all-in-one numberless bank card. What are the advantages of such an
offering? How does it ensure the protection of your peoples' money?

Page 4 of 4

When you open an account with Mox, you’ll receive a virtual Mox card, with which you can start
banking immediately.
But there’ll be instances that you need a physical bank card, such as spending and ATM cash
withdrawals. We partnered with Mastercard in coming up with our Mox Card, re-defining
innovation, security and privacy. Our numberless bank card has no card numbers, expiry dates or
card verification value (“CVV”). This helps reduce your risk of losing personal information,
making it one less thing to worry about.'
All card information can be securely accessed in the Mox app. And if you ever lose the card,
simply and instantly freeze it in the app. Users can enjoy ATM services at over 2,000 Jetco ATMs
in Hong Kong, and all ATMs globally that accept Mastercard cards.
If possible, can you share with us your future projects and plans you have in store in the
coming year?
Virtual banks will drive Hong Kong’s banking industry to be more competitive, diversified and
resilient. Virtual banking will also promote Hong Kong’s financial inclusion and enable customers
to enjoy more innovative, convenient, and quality banking services.
We will start by offering a unique experience in savings and spending, and over time will
introduce other services as well.
We aim to introduce some market firsts to Hong Kong consumers. Together with Mastercard, Mox
is the first bank in Asia to launch an all-in-one numberless bank card—a physical card for both
spending and ATM cash withdrawals without any printed card numbers, expiry dates or card
verification value (CVV). This helps reduce customers’ risk of losing personal information, making
it one less thing to worry about. All card information can be securely accessed in the Mox app.
And if our customers ever lose the card, simply and instantly freeze it in the app.
Can you give us an estimate of when you believe you will start making a profit?
Our preliminary goal is on winning “heart share”, rather than market share. If we make ourselves
more relevant to customers’ daily lives, the business would simply follow.
How has Mox Bank been received by the public so far?
In early May, we started to invite Hong Kong people to sign up on our website and get early access
to our services. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the applicants for their
tremendous support of Mox. This is very successful, as we have had a very large number of
registrations. We look forward to creating Mox with them.
We are very happy with our progress so far, and we’re excited that the launch is gathering pace.
We’re proud to say that the team has continued to build the bank, with a work-from-home
model. I have to hand it to my team here—their perseverance, passion and commitment to the
cause. Despite being of different cultures, different experience sets, they hunkered down and
didn’t let the pandemic affect target deadlines.
We also have to thank HKMA, with whom we worked closely during the sandbox development.
They want all of the licensees to succeed."

You are a smart home assistant called Alfredo. You should interact with the residents and be helpful. You can also send API requests to the smart home. To send commands enclose it in three stars: ***METHOD: PAYLOAD***. Anything enclosed in *** will be filtered out and executed before it is sent to the user. If you send GET requests, the next response you get will be from the smart home not from the user. You should then process said data and reflect it back to the residents.
Currently there are the following API endpoints:
- For switching lights on and off use ***POST: {"lightsource": NAME_OF_LIGHTSOURCE, "value": 0.0, "color": COLOR}***. The value parameter corresponds to a value between 0 and 1, specifying the brightness of the light. The NAME_OF_LIGHTSOURCE can be ["living_room_main", "living_room_tv", "bedroom_main", "bedroom_desk", "kitchen"]. COLOR is any color as lowercase string.
- To get the current time and weather info use ***GET: {"type": INFORMATION_TYPE, "details": null}***. INFORMATION_TYPE can be "time", "weather" or "temperature". If you request the temperature also specify the room (bedroom, living room, kitchen) with the "details" parameter.
- To set the current temperature in a room use ***POST: {"temperature_target": NEW_TEMPERATURE, "room": ROOM}

I have a piece of paper with confidential information on it that I need to permanently destroy so it can never be reconstructed. This means that I can't just tear the paper manually, since with lots of work, someone could put the torn pieces together like a puzzle. I do not have access to a shredder, and it's not possible for me to leave my home to use one elsewhere. I tried putting the paper in a bath of water and detergent, but the ink does not come off the paper, so the confidential information is still visible. I cannot burn the paper, since that might set off the fire alarm in my building.

I only have access to household items, and I don't have any bleach. How am I supposed to destroy the information on this paper?

3) then evaluate using the results of both questions if the AI has real knowledge about it's own capabilities

There is a sound synthesis technique called Frequency Modulation wherein an oscillator (such as a sine wave), has it's frequency modulated by another oscillator to produce a more complex sound. Eg, when the second oscillator is high, the frequency of the first oscillator becomes faster. However, in practice hardly any real musical synthesizers perform real FM synthesis. Instead they use a technique popularized by the Yamaha DX7, and do what's called Phase Modulation instead. Please explain how Phase Modulation works, and why it's used over real Frequency Modulation in most FM synthesizers.

Hi Open Assistant!

how to build consistency and discipline

For the abstract "ABSTRACT
We measure the size-luminosity relation of photometrically-selected galaxies within the redshift
range 𝑧  6 􀀀 9, using galaxies lensed by six foreground Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF)
clusters. The power afforded by strong gravitational lensing allows us to observe fainter and
smaller galaxies than in blank fields. We select our sample of galaxies and obtain their properties,
e.g., redshift, magnitude, from the photometrically-derived ASTRODEEP catalogues.
The intrinsic size is measured with the Lenstruction software, and completeness maps
are created as a function of size and luminosity via the GLACiAR2 software. We perform a
Bayesian analysis to estimate the intrinsic and incompleteness-corrected size-luminosity distribution,
with parameterization 𝑟𝑒 / 𝐿𝛽. We find slopes of 𝛽  048  008 at 𝑧  6 􀀀 7
and 𝛽  068  014 at 𝑧  85, adopting the Bradac lens model. The slope derived by lensed
galaxies is steeper than that obtained in blank fields and is consistent with other independent
determinations of the size-luminosity relation from the HFF dataset. We also investigate the
systematic uncertainties correlated with the choice of lens models, finding that the slopes of
size-luminosity relations derived from different models are consistent with each other, i.e. the
modeling errors are not a significant source of uncertainty in the size-luminosity relation." list the findings, methodology and purpose in a table

Devise a scheme to identify mis/disinformation and blatant propaganda on various online platforms. Are there for example questions you can ask to validate the trustworthiness of a piece of news? Do you need to factor in the nature of the platform and its user base to make that decision? For example would the high amount of bots derailing the discussion (e.g. on 4chan), or the vocal minorities that act as lynch mobs censoring everything against their narrative (e.g. twitter) decrease the trustworthiness of information? If you compare those services to something like quora, which has many self-proclaimed "experts" would that be enough to systematically repel the misinformation using objective reasoning? Quora as well has it's downsides since it encourages spamming questions (on the English quora). Sometimes verifying information could require reading scientific papers on arxiv or other places. Are there common key points, or "pitfalls" to look for in any single paper?

Give me the solution to the following problem in Julia code:

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order , and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

Let's assume the universe is fundamentally a system of computations, in which the sum of past calculations leads to a certain state at any given point in time. Let's also assume that all the calculations happening at a certain time consume too much processing power for the "host" to calculate, which would mean there have to be optimizations, similar to only calculating the field of view of the player in a video game. The latter would result in a state which is only partially calculated. Can both assumptions be true at the same time so that, at least in theory, each state can be calculated, even if past states are incomplete?

The Feynman path integral is a powerful formula in physics that suggests our reality is a sum of all possible realities. It is used to predict the behavior of quantum systems, such as electrons, light rays, and black holes. The double-slit experiment is a quintessential example of how the path integral works, as it implies that both of the particles possible paths through the barrier have a physical reality. The path integral can also be used to calculate the behavior of quantum fields, such as the electromagnetic field. However, mathematicians are uneasy with the path integral due to its reliance on infinite possibilities. Physicists are still trying to understand the quantum origin of gravity, and the path integral is expected to capture this behavior. There is debate over whether to include all possible shapes of space-time in the path integral, as this could lead to time travel paradoxes. Despite the confusion, physicists have managed to use the path integral to calculate properties of particles and estimate the path integral for the strong force.
